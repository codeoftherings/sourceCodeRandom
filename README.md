# sourceCodeRandom
Random source codes for simple console programmes. These source codes are independent of each other and each perform a different function. There'll be a description for every code I've written here in the README. 
Please note that some of the codes are written as a solution to some problems to online judge Hackerrank.com or SPOJ.com, etc. Proceed with caution, although I will mention which are solutions.
